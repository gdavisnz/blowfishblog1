<h2>Grant Davis</h2>


<p>I am a solution architect for a cloud service provider in New Zealand,  I have been passionate about all things tech for 20 plus years now. I am interested in all things VMware, cloud, DevOps, and I also enjoy a spot of coding.

The reason for starting this blog is to keep my skills up to date and hopefully find opportunities to tinker in my home lab.

In my spare time, I'm a huge video game nerd and enjoy spending time with my partner and daughter.</P>
